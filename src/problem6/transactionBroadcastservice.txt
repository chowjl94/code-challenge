
To sign and broadcast transactions on the blockchain , we should take into account scalability, reliability, and security
The service should be designed with scalability, reliability, and security in mind.

To design a transaction broadcaster service, the following specifications are recommended:

5 main areas we can look into

1- Service Architecture:
We can implement microservice architecture with each service responsible for a specific function.
It should be scalabile(ability to handle large number of transaction) , reliable(should peform well) and secure

2- API exposure
The Broadcasting service should have an API that is being exposed to clients for Broadcasting
This APIs should be implemented and be secured with HTTPs protocols , rate limiting, authentication mechanisms
for security

3- Transcation mechanisms
    A. signing: using Private Keys  and secure key management system

    B. broadcast: Transactions should be boradcasted to EVM compatible chains. 
                  A retry mechanism for failure handling without continuous spamming to the network

    C. monitoring: Tracking statuses of transaction in real-time for client feedback
                   analytics can be integrated here as well( volume , status , performance)

4- Backup 
In the event of a system failure , a mechanism can be implemented by inserting transaction data in another database
and duplicated across serveral nodes.


5- Admin Based Controls
Admins rights to manage the service through an interface, monitoring peformance and configuring/modifying the service.
Access to logs for root cause analysis , tracking peformance and troubleshooting.
